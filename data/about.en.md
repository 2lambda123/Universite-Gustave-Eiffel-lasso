The LASSO platform was developed as part of the I-SITE FUTURE project - 2020 call for "exploratory" projects. Additional funding was provided by the ETIS laboratory (joint research department between CYU Cergy Paris University, ENSEA Graduate School of Electrical Engineering and CNRS/INS2I). The researchers behind the project are mainly Dr. Pierre AUMOND, Pr. Catherine Lavandier and Dr. Paul Chapron. The technical implementation of the platform was carried out by the company OuestWare. 

All the authors would like to thank the sources of funding.

We hope this platform will inspire further work on the mapping of urban sound environments!
