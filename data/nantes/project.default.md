# Paysages Sonores Nantais - Nantes Sounscape

As part of the pedagogical curriculum for first year students in the Faculty of Geography at the University of Nantes, students are invited to spend a week "outside the classroom". In 2019 and 2020, the theme was the discovery of the soundscapes of Nantes. Each March of those years, about 120 students went to their field in groups of 5 during 3 afternoons. Tuesday afternoon was devoted to collecting physical and subjective data on 20 listening points per group, located on the pedestria n and road network. In total, 650 listening points were investigated. For each of these points, 3 minutes of measurements (L Aeq and L A90 were calculated) were carried out using the NoiseCapture app. In addition, 1 to 5 students filled questionnaires on the ir perception of the sound environment (circumplex circle of affect, time presence of sound sources, temporal structure of the sound environment...).
