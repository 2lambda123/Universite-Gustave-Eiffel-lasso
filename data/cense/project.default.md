# CENSE

Reducing urban noise is a societal priority. In this context, the European Directive 2002/49/EC aims to produce strategic noise maps for large cities. However, nowadays, the relevance of these maps is questionable due to significant uncertainties that are not quantified. Conversely, the deployment of noise observatories provides a more realistic description of the sound environment, but at the cost of insufficient spatial details and significant expenses. Thus, the CENSE project aims to propose a new methodology for the production of more realistic noise maps, based on the assimilation of simulated and measured data through a dense network of low-cost sensors. Beyond the production of physical indicators, the project also focuses on the characterization of sound environments. The CENSE project is a decidedly multidisciplinary project, bringing together experts in environmental acoustics, data assimilation, statistics, GIS, sensor networks, signal processing, and soundscape.
